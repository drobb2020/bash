    <h1>SLES & OES2 Server Health Report</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>Please find attached today's SLES and OES2 server health report.</p>
    <p>
      The attached file should be stored for historical reference. Save the file
      to this location: <u>T:\Reports\ServerHealthReports\</u>
    </p>
    <h2>SLES Health Report</h2>
    <h3>SLES Version</h3>
    <p>The SLES version should not change unless an upgrade was performed.</p>
    <h3>OES2 Version</h3>
    <p>The OES2 version should not change unless an update was performed.</p>
    <h3>Kernel Version</h3>
    <p>The Kernel version should not change unless an upgrade was performed.</p>
    <h3>IP Address and Hostname</h3>
    <p>
      The IP Address should not change unless the server has been moved. The
      hostname should not change unless the server has been renamed.
    </p>
    <h3>Server Uptime</h3>
    <p>
      If the server uptime is less than 24 hours please find out why the server
      was rebooted within the last day. You can check for the last time the
      server was rebooted by using the command <b>last reboot</b>. This will
      report the exact date and time of the last server reboot.
    </p>
    <h3>Server Memory</h3>
    <p>
      Memory should be assigned with a small portion free, and there should be a
      large number of cache buffers free, and swap should not be heavily used.
      If the numbers look strange please investigate by using the
      <b>top</b> command to see to which daemons are consuming the most memory.
    </p>
    <h3>File System Space Report</h3>
    Please review the file system report and act on any partition that is
    reporting more than 75% full. Use this command to locate large files:<br />
    <b>find / -size +10240000c -exec du -h {} \; | less</b><br />
    <p>
      This command will find all files from the root of the file system that are
      larger than 10 MB. The command should be issued from a terminal window
      (local or remote). For best results you should be authenticated as root.
    </p>
    <h3>Critical Daemon Status</h3>
    <p>
      Please verify that all critical services are running and responding
      correctly. If a daemon is stopped or dead, please PuTTY to the server and
      restart the affected daemon.
    </p>
    <h2>OES2 Health Report</h2>
    <p>
      Please review the OES2 Health section and act on any eDirectory problems.
      If you are unsure of running these commands by yourself please contact
      your primary administrator to ensure you are doing the right thing before
      doing anything.
    </p>
    <h3>NCP Connections</h3>
    <p>
      If the number of NCP connections seem to be abnormally high it may be that
      watchdog is not running. In the Novell Remote Manger (NoRM) for the server
      ensure that FIRST_WATCHDOG_PACKET is set to at least 5 (minutes).
    </p>
    <h3>NCP Service Statistics</h3>
    <p>
      When the cache numbers get very high it is an indication that the server
      might require a reboot, particularly if users are finding access to
      volumes slow.
    </p>
    <h3>NCP Thread Usage</h3>
    <p>
      NCP thread usage is a critical component to overall server health and
      performance. If you consistently find that you are getting NCP thread
      exhaustion you may need to increase the number of additional SSG threads.
      This number can be set anywhere between 1 and 103, with 50 being a good
      starting point.
    </p>
    <h3>NDS Status</h3>
    <p>Please ensure that all servers are up and responding.</p>

    <h3>Timesync Status</h3>
    <p>All Servers should be "in sync" with a +/- tolerance of 2.</p>
    <h4>To Fix timesync issues:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Open a PuTTY or ssh session to the server that is not in timesync.
      </li>
      <li>Authenticate as root.</li>
      <li>
        Run the following command: <b>rcntp restart</b> <br /> this will restart the
        ntp daemon and bring the server back into sync.
      </li>
      <li>
        Run the following command: <b>ndsrepair -T</b> <br /> this will confirm that
        the server is back in sync.
      </li>
      <li>Exit the PuTTY or ssh session when satisfied.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Replica Sync Status</h3>
    <p>
      All replica's should be "in sync", and there should be no evident
      communications issues between servers.
    </p>
    <h4>To fix Replica sync issues:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Open a PuTTY or ssh session to the server that is showing a replica sync
        problem.
      </li>
      <li>Authenticate as root.</li>
      <li>
        Run the following command: <b>rcndsd restart</b> <br /> this will restart the
        nds daemon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Run the following command: <b>ndsrepair -E</b> <br /> this will report the
        current replica sync status. If issues are present run the next command,
        otherwise you can leave the session.
      </li>
      <li>
        Run the following command: <b>ndsrepair -R -l y</b> <br /> this will run a
        full repair with the database locked.
      </li>
      <li>
        If issues are still present after the repair research the individual
        error numbers (i.e -618, 625, etc...) and proceeded with the recommended
        course of action to rectify the situation.
      </li>
      <li>Exit the PuTTY or ssh session when satisfied.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Obituary Status</h3>
    <p>
      An obituary is an object that has been deleted from the tree on one server
      but has not or did not replicate to the server listing the obit.
    </p>
    
    <section class="container">
      <h4>To fix stuck Obits:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Open a PuTTY or ssh session to the server holding the obit(s).</li>
        <li>Authenticate as root.</li>
        <li>
          Run the following command: <b>ndsrepair -C -Ad -OT</b> <br /> this will reset the timestamps on all external references, and process the obituaries.
        </li>
        <li>
          Run the following command: <b>ndsrepair -C -Ad -A</b> <br /> this will report any remaining obituaries on the server. At this point there should be none.
        </li>
        <li>Exit the PuttY or ssh session when satisfied.</li>
      </ol>
